# Shape Matcher Game - Interview Test

## Objective

Create a simple game that tests a candidate's React and TypeScript skills. The game involves matching pairs of randomly generated shapes displayed on a grid. The candidate must demonstrate their ability to work with React components, state management, TypeScript types, and basic styling.

## Description

1. The game board consists of a 4x4 grid (total of 16 cells).
2. Each cell contains a randomly generated shape (circle, square, or triangle) in a random color (red, green, or blue).
3. The grid should have 8 pairs of matching shapes/colors.
4. When a user clicks on a cell, the shape/color is revealed.
5. The user can only reveal two cells at a time.
6. If the revealed shapes/colors match, the cells remain open.
7. If the revealed shapes/colors don't match, the cells are automatically hidden after a 1-second delay.
8. The game ends when all pairs are matched, and the user is shown a completion message with the number of attempts it took to finish the game.

## Requirements

1. Use React and TypeScript to develop the game.
2. Use functional components and React Hooks for state management.
3. Create custom TypeScript types for shape, color, and game state.
4. Style the game using CSS modules or styled-components.
5. Ensure the game is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Assessment Criteria

1. Code quality and organization: Proper use of React components, TypeScript types, and styling techniques.
2. Functionality: The game should work as described and be free of bugs.
3. State management: Efficient and clean use of React Hooks for state management.
4. Responsiveness: The game should look and work well on various screen sizes.
5. Bonus: Add a timer to track how long it takes to complete the game.
6. Bonus: Unit Testing: Writing unit tests for the components and game logic using Jest and React Testing Library is a huge plus. 

## Steps to Submit

1. Clone this repository
2. Complete the game
3. Push to your git
4. Submit the Git URL

This test should take a skilled React/TypeScript developer between 30-60 minutes to complete.
